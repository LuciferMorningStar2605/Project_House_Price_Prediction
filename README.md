## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates the use of **Machine Learning regression models** to predict house prices based on given features. By leveraging **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and regression techniques**, the model provides reliable estimates that can be applied in the **real estate industry** to assist buyers, sellers, and financial institutions.  

The entire pipeline was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`project_house.ipynb`) and trained on the dataset `data.csv`.

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with statistical summaries & visualizations  
✔️ Correlation analysis to identify key predictors of house prices  
✔️ Multiple regression models for prediction  
✔️ Model evaluation using industry-standard metrics (R², MAE, MSE)  
✔️ Visual insights into feature importance and model performance
